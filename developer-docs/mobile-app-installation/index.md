## Introduction

The Sunbird Mobile app provides mobility to its feature-rich learning platform. It provides learners with the flexibility to learn anywhere, anytime.

## Prerequisites
<br>1.To set up Sunbird mobile app, ensure you have installed the following:
<br>&emsp;a) NPM Version - 6.+
<br>&emsp;b) Node JS Version -  8.+
<br>&emsp;c) Cordova Version - 8.+
<br>&emsp;d) Ionic Version - 4.11.2
<br>2. Generate the key and secret for the mobile app user using the JWT token of the mobile admin user. Run the **OnboardConsumers** Jenkins Job and take the jwt token(**JWT token for mobile_admin**) from Jenkins Output.

**Generating Secret:**
Execute the listed API to generate the key and secret for the mobile app:

  curl -X POST \   &#60;your-sunbird-base-url&#62;/api/api-manager/v1/consumer/mobile_app/credential/register \
       -H 'authorization: Bearer &#60;mobile_admin_jwt_token_from_jenkins_job_output&#62;' \
       -H 'content-type: application/json' \
       -d '{
       "request": {
         "key": "&#60;implementation-name&#62;-mobile-app- &#60;version-number&#62;"
       }
     }'

**Response body:** 

{"result":{"key":"&#60;implementation-name&#62;-mobile-app-&#60;version-number&#62;","secret":"&#60;secret&#62;"}} 

Use the  key and secret from the response given for MOBILE_APP_KEY and MOBILE_APP_SECRET configuration in respective environments in gradle.properties file. Example:

**dev_mobile_app_key = "&#60;implementation-name&#62;-mobile-app-&#60;version-number&#62;"
dev_mobile_app_secret = "&#60;secret&#62;"**

**Producer Key**

Replace the producer id `PRODUCER_ID` for respective environments in sunbird.properties.

**Fabric credentials:**

Replace `release_fabric_api_key` in `sunbird.properties` with your fabric API Key. Create an account in [fabric.io](https://get.fabric.io/) and register in the app to get the API key.

## Setup mobile app workspace from Git Repository
Sunbird mobile app can be built from the main source code which is available at  [SunbirdEd-mobile-app](https://github.com/Sunbird-Ed/SunbirdEd-mobile-app).

* Clone the [SunbirdEd-mobile-app](https://github.com/Sunbird-Ed/SunbirdEd-mobile-app) repo
* [Customising App Configuration](#customising-app-configuration) - sample.sunbird.properties file is located inside SunbirdEd-mobile-app > buildConfig folder. This has to be renamed to sunbird.properties and appropriate values should be provided.
* [Package the framework and form data](#package-the-framework-and-form-data).
* go to project folder and run **./build.sh**

###  Packaging Framework and Form Data
Sunbird mobile app supports configuration of the app framework to enable offline usage of the app. To configure the app framework, adopter needs to package the channel for the respective framework. Details of the file naming convention and folder location are given below:

| S No. | Folder | File Name |  Purpose 
|-------|--------|-----------|-------------
| 1 | buildConfig/data/framework | framework-&#60;FRAMEWORK_IDENTIFIER&#60;.json | To package the channel for the respective framework. Same framework must be listed in the channel's suggestedFramework list
| 2 | buildConfig/data/channel | channel-&#60;CHANNEL_IDENTIFIER&#62;.json | To package the channel. To support offline usage custodianOrgId channel must be included in the bundle
| 3 | buildConfig/data/form | pageassemble_course_filter.json | Page assemble filter for course
| 4 | buildConfig/data/form | pageassemble_library_filter.json | Page assemble filter for library
| 5 | buildConfig/data/system | &#60;system-setting-custodianOrgId&#62;.json | custodianOrgId channelid for the mobile app
| 6 | buildConfig/data/system | system-setting-courseFrameworkId.json | courseFrameworkId for the TPD workflow
| 7 | buildConfig/data/notificationconfig | local_notofocation_config.json | Configuration for local Notification setup in mobile

### Installing the Mobile Application

  1.Create a workspace (Folder Hierarchy) and clone the Git repositories into this folder

  2.Execute the instructions mentioned for each cloned repository

  3.Open terminal and change the directory to "SunbirdEd-mobile-app" 

  4.Add one device to the system

  5.Run the command- **$ ionic cordova run android**
  
### Generate Multiple Sunbird Apps
As a Sunbird instance owner, owner  should be able to generate multiple apps for multiple environments(dev/qa/production)
so that user can use all the apps simultaneously.
For each app, user should be able to have different content stores (on the local device), fire telemetry from separate app identifiers and upload to playstore (if need be).
#### Configuration
Instance admin of Sunbird adopters can configure the appId in the following way to acheive the functionality
* dev_app_id = org.sample.app.dev
* staging_app_id = org.sample.app.staging
* production_app_id = org.sample.app
