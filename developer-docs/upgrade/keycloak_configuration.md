## Keycloak Configuration

Sunbird uses Keycloak as tool for identity management services. The default storage mechanism stores the user-data in plain format within its local database. There are sensitive information such as mobile number, e-mail that needs to be secured. Therefore data is encrypted in cassandra DB and users are removed from Keycloak DB. 

To summarize we need to resolve following problems, in order to implement such encryption.

Within end-storage (database) user data such as mobile and e-mail need to be stored in encrypted format.

We need to decrypt the data, while communicating with the end-user. For example, for sending email or sms - we need to be able to decrypt the data. 

We need to eventually migrate all existing user data, and store it in encrypted format.

> Note: Take back up of Keycloak database

Switch to postgres user and run 

    `pg_dump keyclaok` > `keycloak_backup.db`


## Configuration Steps:

> Note: As of release-2.0.0 keycloak admin portal is disabled from public internet.

You must tunnel the port in to the local machine via ssh tunnelling. 

`ssh -L 8080:localhost:8080 ops@~keycloak-ip-address~`

1.Login to admin console and navigate to User Federation tab on left panel of the screen as shown in the figure.

2.Select cassandra-storage-provider from Add provider drop down on the screen, then you will be redirected to screen as shown in the figure.

3.Click the Save button. It will generate one provider id as shown in the figure.

4.Copy the provider id and update the private repo inventory under Core/secrets.yml for the variable core_vault_sunbird_keycloak_user_federation_provider_id

5.Run the below SQL queries on Keycloak database after replacing values for placeholders {PROVIDER_ID} and {realm name} in below query templates. Value of placeholders {PROVIDER_ID} and {realm name} is based on environment variables core_sunbird_keycloak_user_federation_provider_id and keycloak_realm respectively.


These below are Postgres queries. So you need to login to postgres and run these queries on keycloak db. Below is the code to switch to keycloak DB.

        psql (9.5.17, server 9.5.16)
        Type "help" for help.

        postgres=> \l

        postgres=> \c keycloak

You are now connected to database "keycloak" 


## Query Templates 


        insert into FEDERATED_USER(ID, STORAGE_PROVIDER_ID, REALM_ID)select concat('f:{PROVIDER_ID}:', USER_ENTITY.ID), '{PROVIDER_ID}', '{realm name}' from public.USER_ENTITY;
        
        insert into FED_USER_CREDENTIAL(ID, DEVICE, HASH_ITERATIONS, SALT, TYPE, VALUE, CREATED_DATE, COUNTER, DIGITS, PERIOD, ALGORITHM, USER_ID,                  REALM_ID,STORAGE_PROVIDER_ID) select ID, DEVICE, HASH_ITERATIONS, SALT, TYPE, VALUE, CREATED_DATE, COUNTER, DIGITS, PERIOD, ALGORITHM, concat('f:{PROVIDER_ID}:',USER_ID), '{realm name}', '{PROVIDER_ID}' from CREDENTIAL;
        
        insert into FED_USER_REQUIRED_ACTION(REQUIRED_ACTION, USER_ID, REALM_ID, STORAGE_PROVIDER_ID)
        select REQUIRED_ACTION, concat('f:{PROVIDER_ID}:', USER_ID), '{realm name}', '{PROVIDER_ID}' from USER_REQUIRED_ACTION;



Example:

    {PROVIDER_ID} = 5a8a3f2b-3409-42e0-9001-f913bc0fde31

    {realm name} = sunbird
        {PROVIDER_ID} = 5a8a3f2b-3409-42e0-9001-f913bc0fde31

        {realm name} = sunbird

        insert into FEDERATED_USER(ID, STORAGE_PROVIDER_ID, REALM_ID) select concat('f:5a8a3f2b-3409-42e0-9001-f913bc0fde31:', USER_ENTITY.ID),'5a8a3f2b-3409-42e0-9001-f913bc0fde31','sunbird'frompublic.USER_ENTITY;
        
        insert into FED_USER_CREDENTIAL(ID, DEVICE, HASH_ITERATIONS, SALT, TYPE, VALUE, CREATED_DATE, COUNTER, DIGITS, PERIOD, ALGORITHM, USER_ID, REALM_ID,STORAGE_PROVIDER_ID) select ID, DEVICE, HASH_ITERATIONS, SALT, TYPE, VALUE, CREATED_DATE, COUNTER, DIGITS, PERIOD, ALGORITHM, concat('f:5a8a3f2b-3409-42e0-9001-f913bc0fde31:',USER_ID),'sunbird','5a8a3f2b-3409-42e0-9001-f913bc0fde31'from CREDENTIAL;
        
        insert into FED_USER_REQUIRED_ACTION(REQUIRED_ACTION, USER_ID, REALM_ID, STORAGE_PROVIDER_ID) select REQUIRED_ACTION, concat('f:5a8a3f2b-3409-42e0-9001-f913bc0fde31:', USER_ID),'sunbird','5a8a3f2b-3409-42e0-9001-f913bc0fde31'from USER_REQUIRED_ACTION;



This completes the Keycloak configurations. Next we will be running migration scripts for Cassandra and Keycloak.
